This program converts a Text file into a Binary file and vice versa and compiled on Unix with a makefile.
Makefile is there for easy compilation for multiple C source files.
Execution requires 4 command line arguments, where the 2nd argument is the flag, 3rd argument is the input file and 4th argument is the output file.
Flags are "-t" for Text->Binary conversion and "-b" for Binary->Text conversion.
Below are examples of how to successfully execute the program and expected outputs from the sample text and binary files provided.
Test cases were provided by my Professor.

Test Cases:

TEXT TO BINARY CONVERSION
-------------------------

converter -t t1.txt output1.bin

	Expected output: b1.bin
	Compare with command: diff output1.bin b1.bin

converter -t t2.txt output2.bin

	Expected output: b2.bin
	Compare with command: diff output2.bin b2.bin

converter -t t3.txt output3.bin

	Expected output: b3.bin
	Compare with command: diff output3.bin b3.bin

converter -t t4.txt output4.bin

	Expected output: b4.bin
	Compare with command: diff output4.bin b4.bin


BINARY TO TEXT CONVERSION
-------------------------

converter -b b1.bin output5.txt

	Expected output: t1.txt

converter -b b2.bin output6.txt

	Expected output: t2.txt

converter -b b3.bin output7.txt

	Expected output: t3.txt

converter -b b4.bin output8.txt
	
	Expected output t4.txt
